Processing DNA in a file
The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequencing adapter that should have been removed.
 Write a program that will
 trim this adapter and write the cleaned sequences to a new file
print the length of each sequence to the screen.
